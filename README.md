# Phaser Game


This is a video game built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io), an open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered games. This game was inspired by [Phaser 3 tutorial: Endless Runner](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1). The main objective was to create a custom role play game.
